Decades of using heavy chemical fertilizers have destroyed the soils natural microbial life, while excessive plowing has broken down its structure. • Overgrazing: When too many cattle or goats are allowed to graze on a piece of land, they eat the vegetation down to the roots and compact the soil with their hooves.

This makes food more expensive and threatens the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. • Increased Flooding: When the land cant act as a natural sponge, heavy rainfall has nowhere to go. This leads to more frequent and severe flash floods, even in cities like Pune. • Water Scarcity and Pollution: Degraded land cant filter water properly. This means our groundwater aquifers dont get recharged, and the runoff carries soil and chemical pollutants into our rivers, contaminating our drinking water sources.')">

They form a dense, fibrous network that physically binds soil particles together, much like rebar in concrete. This creates a strong soil structure that is highly resistant to being washed away by rain (water erosion) or blown away by wind. But it goes deeper: the area around the roots, called the rhizosphere, is a bustling ecosystem of beneficial microbes. These microbes improve nutrient cycling, making the soil healthier and more fertile for all plant life.')" >

                    <p>Tree roots create a dense web that holds soil particles together, preventing erosion from wind and rain.</p>

When heavy rain falls, the canopy intercepts the raindrops, absorbing most of their impact. This prevents splash erosion, where raindrops violently hit bare ground and dislodge soil particles. The water then drips gently onto the forest floor, allowing it to be absorbed slowly by the soil instead of running off and causing floods.')"  >

This is the lifeblood of healthy soil. Humus acts like a sponge, dramatically increasing the soils ability to hold water, which is crucial during dry periods. It also improves soil aeration and provides a slow-release source of essential nutrients for plants. A layer of this organic blanket also protects the soil from the harsh sun, keeping it cool and moist.')">
